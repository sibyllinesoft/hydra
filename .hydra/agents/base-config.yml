# DEFAULT Base Configuration for General Purpose Agents
# Provides core tools with essential MCPs - NO sensitive operations
# Use specialized configs for agents requiring restricted MCPs

# Core Tools Available to Most Agents
default_tools:
  # Essential File Operations
  - Read
  - Write
  - Edit
  - MultiEdit
  - LS
  
  # Command & Search Operations
  - Bash
  - Grep
  - Glob
  
  # Web Operations (for research)
  - WebSearch

# SECURITY NOTE: This config provides MINIMAL MCP access
# For agents requiring specialized access, use appropriate specialized configs:
# - @engineering-base-config.yml (code analysis)
# - @testing-base-config.yml (browser automation)
# - @operations-base-config.yml (data/monitoring)
# - @utility-base-config.yml (knowledge management)

# Total Context Cost: 6,373 words (~13,153 tokens)
# Value: Expert-level context for every agent without conversation setup
# Updated: 2025-08-19 with MCP access restrictions

# Usage Instructions:
# 1. General agents reference "@base-config.yml" for safe operations
# 2. Specialized agents use specific configs for restricted MCP access
# 3. Agent YAML frontmatter only needs: name, description, color
# 4. Tools field can be omitted (inherits from config)
# 5. Configuration files are auto-loaded via description reference

# Access Control Philosophy:
# - Default config: Maximum safety, minimal MCP surface
# - Specialized configs: Targeted access for specific domains
# - No universal access to sensitive operations (supabase, sentry, playwright)

# Example Agent Structure:
# ---
# name: content-agent
# description: |
#   Creates content with research capabilities.
#   @base-config.yml
# color: blue
