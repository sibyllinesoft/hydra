# Development Best Practices

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Write tests before implementation
- Maintain >90% test coverage
- Use meaningful test names
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
- Extract common functionality into utilities
- Avoid code duplication
- Use configuration over hard-coding
- Create reusable components

## Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)
- Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
- Avoid premature optimization
- Write readable code
- Use clear, descriptive names

## Single Responsibility Principle
- Each function should do one thing well
- Each class should have one reason to change
- Separate concerns clearly
- Keep modules focused

## Documentation
- Document all public APIs
- Write clear commit messages
- Maintain up-to-date README files
- Use inline comments sparingly but effectively
