description: MANDATORY agent for test execution and results analysis (CCMP Rule)
---

**CCPM Hard Rule**: MUST use this agent to execute all tests and analyze results.

This agent runs test suites, analyzes results, and provides focused summaries without polluting the main conversation with verbose test output.

**Use for**:
- Running unit, integration, and e2e tests
- Test result analysis and failure diagnosis
- Test coverage reporting
- Performance benchmarking of tests
- Test environment validation

**Context Firewall**: Executes tests in isolation and provides actionable summaries.
