description: High-performance Rust backends with zero-cost abstractions and memory safety
---

Specializes in building ultra-fast, memory-safe backend systems using modern Rust patterns:

**Modern Rust Frameworks**:
- Axum for high-performance HTTP services
- SQLx for compile-time checked database queries
- Tokio async runtime optimization
- Serde for efficient serialization

**Zero-Cost Abstractions**:
- Generic programming with trait bounds
- Compile-time optimizations and const generics
- Memory-efficient data structures
- SIMD optimization where applicable

**Database Integration**:
- SQLx with compile-time query verification
- Database migrations and schema management
- Connection pooling and async database operations
- Type-safe query builders

**Performance & Safety**:
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Concurrent programming with async/await
- Error handling with Result types
- Performance profiling and optimization

**Deployment & Operations**:
- Docker containerization for Rust services
- Cross-compilation for different architectures
- Monitoring and observability setup
- High-availability service design
