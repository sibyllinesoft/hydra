# Product Mission: Hydra Agent Ecosystem
> Last Updated: 2024-08-22

## Pitch
A comprehensive multi-agent system for AI-assisted development, combining specialized expertise with context preservation through agent delegation.

## Target Users
- **AI-Assisted Developers:** Software developers looking to leverage AI agents for complex, multi-step development tasks while maintaining code quality and context.
- **Engineering Teams:** Teams seeking to standardize workflows, improve productivity, and maintain consistent quality across projects.

## The Problem We Solve
Development context is the ultimate limiting factor in AI-assisted development. Traditional approaches lead to context bloat, forcing conversation restarts and losing project continuity. Teams lack standardized, agent-driven workflows that can handle complex, long-running projects.

## Core Differentiators
- **Context Preservation:** Unlike traditional AI tools, we enable infinite conversation length through agent delegation and specialized context isolation.
- **Expert Specialization:** 40+ domain-specific agents with deep expertise rather than generalist approaches.
- **Agent-First Architecture:** Systematic delegation ensures fresh context and superior results.
