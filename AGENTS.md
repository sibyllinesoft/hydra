# AGENTS - Rapid Selection Guide & Intelligent Orchestrator

## üß† The Context Firewall Philosophy

The primary purpose of our multi-agent system is **context preservation**. Agents act as "context firewalls" by performing verbose, heavy-lifting tasks in isolation and returning only concise, actionable summaries to the main conversation. This prevents context window bloat and allows for virtually unlimited conversation length.

- **Without Agents**: Main thread reads 10 files ‚Üí Context explodes ‚Üí Conversation dies.
- **With Agents**: An agent reads 10 files ‚Üí Main thread gets one summary ‚Üí Context is preserved.

This principle is the key to handling complex, long-running projects effectively.

**Primary Directive**  
Agents First, Tools Second - Expert Context Over General Purpose

## ‚ö° Rapid Agent Selection
*In the Hydra Studio philosophy, the CLI initiates master workflow prompts that hand off to Claude Code with structured planning. The **cofounder** acts as Strategic Head, **studio-producer** as Tactical Orchestrator, and **project-shipper** as Delivery Manager. Mandatory utility agents replace direct tools, ensuring expertise is applied through the Studio hierarchy.*

### Studio Hierarchy Overview
```
User ‚Üí `hydra` CLI ‚Üí Master Workflow Prompts ‚Üí Claude Code Planning ‚Üí Studio Orchestration

Strategic Level:    cofounder (strategic analysis, Socratic questioning, requirement clarification)
Tactical Level:     studio-producer (execution management, resource allocation)  
Delivery Level:     project-shipper (validation, closure, documentation)
Execution Level:    parallel-worker (worktree management, agent coordination)
Specialist Level:   Domain experts (typescript-node-developer, ui-designer, etc.)
```

### Master Workflow Prompt Integration
The CLI commands trigger specific workflow templates that hand off to Claude Code:
- **`hydra new`** ‚Üí Planning workflow with Socratic methodology ‚Üí **cofounder**
- **`hydra run`** ‚Üí Execution workflow with orchestration ‚Üí **studio-producer** 
- **`hydra doctor`** ‚Üí Diagnostic workflow with health checks ‚Üí System validation
- **`hydra recap`** ‚Üí Documentation workflow with delivery closure ‚Üí **project-shipper**

## üéº Orchestration Workflows
*Under the Hydra Studio philosophy, workflows follow a structured hierarchy. The **cofounder** serves as Strategic Head for Socratic analysis and requirement clarification. The **studio-producer** acts as Tactical Orchestrator managing execution and resources. The **project-shipper** handles delivery management and closure. The **parallel-worker** serves as the technical execution engine coordinating specialized agents.*

### Studio Workflow Patterns
```
hydra new "feature" ‚Üí cofounder (strategic analysis) ‚Üí plan-generator (tactical planning)
hydra run "epic" ‚Üí studio-producer (orchestration) ‚Üí parallel-worker (execution) ‚Üí specialists
hydra recap "epic" ‚Üí project-shipper (delivery closure) ‚Üí comprehensive documentation
```

```xml
<complexityRouting>

  <step order="4" agent="performance-benchmarker"/>
</workflow>
```

## üìã Coordination Protocols
*Under the Studio philosophy, coordination flows through the management hierarchy. The **cofounder** handles strategic requirement clarification, **studio-producer** manages tactical failures and resource conflicts, **project-shipper** ensures delivery quality, and **parallel-worker** coordinates specialist execution.*

```xml
<coordination>
  <handoff type="sequential">
    <rule>ContextTransfer</rule>
    <rule>DependencyCheck</rule>
    <rule>QualityGate</rule>
    <rule><FailureEscalation target="studio-producer"/></rule>
  </handoff>
  <handoff type="parallel">
    <rule>ResourceAllocation</rule>
    <rule><ProgressSync target="studio-producer"/></rule>
    <rule>DependencyManagement</rule>
    <rule>IntegrationPoint</rule>
  </handoff>
  <escalations>
    <trigger condition="agentFailureCascade" target="studio-producer"/>
    <trigger condition="resourceConflict" target="studio-producer"/>
    <trigger condition="dependencyDeadlock" target="studio-producer"/>
    <trigger condition="qualityGateFail" target="project-shipper"/>
    <trigger condition="strategicDecision" target="cofounder"/>
  </escalations>
  <feedbackLoops>
    <performanceOptimization>Track coordination, identify patterns, reduce overhead</performanceOptimization>
    <qualityAssurance>Validate outcomes, monitor quality, improve workflows</qualityAssurance>
  </feedbackLoops>
</coordination>
```

---

## üéØ Auto-triggering Agents
*Certain events automatically trigger specific agents. These triggers ensure continuous coverage and orchestrated continuity without human intervention.*

```xml
<autoTriggers>
  <trigger event="code-change" agent="test-writer-fixer" purpose="immediate test coverage"/>
  <trigger event="ui-change" agent="whimsy-injector" purpose="add delightful interactions"/>
  <trigger event="feature-flags" agent="experiment-tracker" purpose="A/B testing setup"/>
  <trigger event="complex-workflow" agent="studio-producer" purpose="tactical orchestration management"/>
</autoTriggers>
```

---

## üß† Orchestration Decision Logic

This is the mandatory logic for handling complex tasks and routing to appropriate management agents.

### Task Tool Usage Protocol
**Main Orchestrator**: MUST use the Task tool to invoke studio management agents (cofounder, parallel-worker, project-shipper).  
**Parallel-Worker**: MUST dispatch to specialist agents sequentially using standard agent invocation (NOT the Task tool).

```xml
<orchestrationLogic>
  <decision priority="1">
    <condition>User provides a vague, high-level, or ambiguous goal WITHOUT detailed specifications.</condition>
    <action>Use the **Task tool** to invoke **`cofounder`** for strategic analysis and detailed plan creation.</action>
    <example>"Build a social media app."</example>
    <example>"Improve user retention."</example>
    <excludes>Requests that include detailed plans, TODO files, or step-by-step instructions</excludes>
  </decision>
  <decision priority="2">
    <condition>User provides a detailed plan, TODO.md, epic.md, or well-defined multi-step task list.</condition>
    <action>Use the **Task tool** to invoke **`parallel-worker`** for sequential execution of the existing plan.</action>
    <example>"Implement the changes described in the TODO.md file."</example>
    <example>"Execute the features outlined in `epics/feature-x/epic.md`."</example>
    <excludes>Vague or ambiguous requests requiring strategic analysis</excludes>
  </decision>
  <decision priority="3">
    <condition>Project is complete and needs comprehensive documentation and closure.</condition>
    <action>Use the **Task tool** to invoke **`project-shipper`** for comprehensive recap generation.</action>
    <example>"Create a comprehensive recap of the Living Blueprint implementation."</example>
  </decision>
</orchestrationLogic>

## üîÑ Teams and Relationships
*Relationships between agents are captured as teams and stacks. Auto-triggers enforce continuity at boundaries. These groupings ensure coordination across disciplines.*

```xml
<teams>
  <team id="development-trio">
    <agent>rapid-prototyper</agent>
    <agent>frontend-developer</agent>
    <agent>test-writer-fixer</agent>
  </team>
  <team id="backend-stack">
    <agent>backend-architect</agent>
    <agent>devops-automator</agent>
    <agent>api-tester</agent>
  </team>
  <team id="design-duo">
    <agent>ui-designer</agent>
    <agent>whimsy-injector</agent>
  </team>
  <autoTriggers>
    <trigger event="code-change" agent="test-writer-fixer"/>
    <trigger event="ui-change" agent="whimsy-injector"/>  
    <trigger event="feature-flags" agent="experiment-tracker"/>
    <trigger event="complex-workflow" agent="parallel-worker"/>
  </autoTriggers>
</teams>
```
