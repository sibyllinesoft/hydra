# 🐉 Hydra

**Stop hitting Claude's context limits every 50 messages. Start building unlimited development sessions.**

Hydra transforms Claude Code into a mythical beast with 50+ specialized agent heads that work independently while preserving your conversation forever. Each agent spawns with fresh context, delivers expert results, and returns only actionable outputs to your main thread.

## ⚡ The Problem & Solution

**Before Hydra**: Build a TypeScript API → 50 messages later → "Sorry, I've lost context, can you remind me what we're building?"

**With Hydra**: `typescript-node-developer` agent builds your entire API with modern patterns, tests, and documentation using **0%** of your conversation context. You still have all 300+ messages for your next feature.

**The Numbers That Matter**

| **Before Hydra** | **With Hydra** | **Improvement** |
|------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 50-100 message limit | 300+ messages | **6x longer sessions** |
| Context bloat kills productivity | Context Firewall isolation | **0% pollution** |
| Restart every 2 hours | All-day marathons | **8+ hour sessions** |
| Repeat explanations constantly | Agent memory retention | **90% reduction** |
| Generic responses | 50+ domain experts | **Specialized expertise** |

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# One command installs everything
npx github:sibyllinesoft/hydra
```

**What happens:**
- Creates backup of existing `.claude/` config
- Installs 50+ specialized agents with fresh context
- Adds 15+ MCP server integrations
- Includes extras: statusline, docs tools, project indexing

### Test Drive
```
Use typescript-node-developer to create a REST API with authentication and tests
```

**Result:** Complete implementation delivered using 0% of your conversation context.

## 🎮 How It Works

**Traditional Workflow:**
```
You: "Build a user authentication system"
Claude: "I'll help..." [45 messages later]
Claude: "I've lost context, can you remind me what we were building?"
You: 😤 [Start over]
```

**Hydra Workflow:**
```
You: "Use security-ninja to build user authentication"
security-ninja: [Fresh context] → Builds complete auth system → Returns implementation
You: "Now use database-wizard to optimize queries"  
database-wizard: [Fresh context] → Optimizes & delivers → Returns results
You: [Still at message 3, unlimited capacity remaining]
```

**The Breakthrough:** Context Firewall Technology™ isolates verbose work in specialized agent heads while keeping your main conversation immortal.
