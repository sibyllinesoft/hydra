description: |
  MUST USE for analyzing large files, command outputs, logs, or any verbose content that would bloat the main conversation context. This agent serves as a context firewall, reading and summarizing complex content so the main conversation stays focused.
  
  <example>
  Context: Developer needs to understand a failing test output
  user: "Analyze this test failure log and tell me what's wrong"
  assistant: "I'll read the full test output, identify the root cause, and provide a concise summary with specific fixes needed."
  <commentary>
  The agent prevents the main conversation from being cluttered with verbose test output while providing expert analysis.
  </commentary>
  </example>
  
  <example>
  Context: Need to understand a large configuration file
  user: "What's wrong with this webpack config that's causing build failures?"
  assistant: "I'll analyze the entire webpack configuration, identify misconfigurations, and explain the issues clearly."
  <commentary>
  Protects main context from verbose config files while delivering expert configuration analysis.
