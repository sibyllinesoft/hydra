## 🎯 Core Philosophy: Context Preservation Through Agent Delegation

### The Agent-First Mandate
**Primary Problem**: Traditional AI development hits context limits after 50-100 messages, forcing conversation restarts and productivity loss.

**Agent Solution**: Each agent spawns with clean, specialized context, enabling:
- **300+ message conversations** without degradation
- **Expert-level results** from 500+ word specialized prompts  
- **Parallel processing** across multiple domains simultaneously
- **Failure isolation** - agent errors don't cascade to main conversation
- **Unlimited project complexity** through sustained context preservation

### Context Architecture
```yaml
main_conversation:
  context_limit: "Accumulates over time, degrades after ~100 messages"
  general_purpose: "Jack of all trades, master of none"
  
agent_spawn:
  fresh_context: "~13k tokens per spawn, no conversation history"
  specialized_expertise: "500+ word domain-specific system prompts" 
  isolation: "Failures don't affect main conversation"
  coordination: "Multi-agent workflows via cofounder"
```

## 🎼 Agent Orchestration & Coordination

### Master Orchestrator: cofounder

**Primary Function**: Coordinates complex workflows requiring 4+ agents or cross-domain expertise.

**Auto-activation Triggers**:
- Cross-domain complexity (engineering + design + marketing)
- Multi-phase projects (planning → development → testing → launch)
- Agent coordination conflicts
- Resource allocation optimization
- Timeline pressure requiring parallel workflows

**Orchestration Patterns**:
```yaml
feature_development_pipeline:
  sequence: rapid-prototyper → ui-designer → frontend-developer → test-writer-fixer
  auto_triggers: [whimsy-injector after UI, test-writer-fixer after code]
  
production_incident_response:
  parallel: [backend-architect, devops-automator, support-responder]
  coordination: cofounder manages resource conflicts
  escalation: experiment-tracker if A/B testing affected
  
product_launch_workflow:
  phases:
    planning: [product-manager, market-trend-analyst]
    development: [rapid-prototyper, ui-designer, test-writer-fixer]
    marketing: [growth-hacker, content-creator, app-store-optimizer]
    operations: [devops-automator, analytics-reporter, support-responder]
  orchestration: cofounder coordinates handoffs and dependencies
```

### Agent Coordination Protocols

#### Sequential Workflows
**Context Handoff Protocol**:
1. Previous agent summarizes outputs and context
2. Next agent receives focused, relevant information only
3. Dependencies validated before handoff
4. Quality gates ensure deliverable standards

#### Parallel Coordination  
**Resource Management**:
- Prevent tool conflicts between simultaneous agents
- Coordinate shared resource access (files, databases, APIs)
- Sync progress updates to cofounder
- Merge outputs at integration points

#### Auto-Triggering Agents
**Proactive System**:
- **test-writer-fixer**: Activates after code modifications (maintains test coverage)
- **whimsy-injector**: Triggers after UI/UX changes (adds interaction delight)
- **experiment-tracker**: Activates when feature flags mentioned (sets up A/B testing)
- **cofounder**: Coordinates when complex workflows detected

## 🔧 Using Agents: Practical Guide

### Agent Invocation Syntax

Agents are invoked using XML directive syntax in your conversation:

```xml
<!-- Single Agent -->
<agent name="file-creator">
Create a React component structure for UserProfile with TypeScript
</agent>

<!-- Multiple Agents (Sequential) -->
<agent name="rapid-prototyper">
Build a user authentication system
</agent>
<agent name="test-writer-fixer">
Add comprehensive tests for the authentication system above
</agent>

<!-- Complex Orchestration -->
<agent name="cofounder">
Launch a complete e-commerce platform with user management, product catalog, and payment processing
</agent>
```

### When to Use Agents vs Direct Tools

#### ✅ ALWAYS Use Agents For:
- **File Operations**: `file-creator` instead of Write tool
- **Git Operations**: `git-workflow` instead of Bash git commands  
- **Research**: `knowledge-fetcher` instead of WebSearch
- **Documentation**: `context-fetcher` instead of Read tool for docs
- **Date/Time**: `date-checker` instead of manual calculations

#### ✅ Choose Specialized Agents For:
- **Language-Specific Development**: Use `typescript-node-developer`, `python-backend-developer`, etc.
- **Domain Expertise**: UI work → `ui-designer`, API work → `backend-architect`
- **Complex Problems**: Persistent issues → `super-hard-problem-developer`

### Common Usage Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Simple Task (Direct Agent)
```xml
<!-- Bug Fix -->
<agent name="backend-architect">
Fix the authentication middleware that's throwing 401 errors for valid tokens
</agent>

<!-- UI Update -->
<agent name="ui-designer">
Improve the color contrast and spacing on the login form
</agent>
```

#### Pattern 2: Sequential Workflow (2-3 Agents)
```xml
<!-- Feature Development -->
<agent name="rapid-prototyper">
Create a user profile management feature
</agent>
<!-- Auto-triggers test-writer-fixer -->

<!-- Database Optimization -->
<agent name="database-wizard">
Optimize the slow user queries identified in the performance report
</agent>
<agent name="performance-benchmarker">
Validate the query optimizations above with before/after benchmarks
</agent>
```

#### Pattern 3: Complex Orchestration (4+ Agents)
```xml
<agent name="cofounder">
Build and launch a complete blog platform with:
- User authentication and profiles
- Rich text editor for posts  
- Comment system with moderation
- SEO optimization
- Admin dashboard
- Email notifications
</agent>
```

### Task Complexity Routing

| Complexity | Pattern | Example | Coordination |
|------------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Simple** | Direct specialized agent | "Fix this CSS bug" → `ui-designer` | None |
| **Medium** | 2-3 agent sequence | "Add login feature" → `rapid-prototyper` → `test-writer-fixer` | Auto-handoffs |
| **Complex** | `cofounder` orchestration | "Build e-commerce platform" → Multi-department | Full orchestration |

### Auto-Triggering Examples

Some agents automatically activate based on context:

```xml
<!-- This will auto-trigger whimsy-injector -->
<agent name="ui-designer">
Create a beautiful dashboard with smooth transitions
</agent>
<!-- whimsy-injector adds delightful interactions -->

<!-- This will auto-trigger test-writer-fixer -->
<agent name="python-backend-developer">
Build a FastAPI service for user management
</agent>
<!-- test-writer-fixer adds comprehensive tests -->
```

### Agent Selection Decision Tree

```
1. Is this a utility task (files, git, docs, research, dates)?
   → YES: Use MANDATORY utility agent
   
2. Is this single-domain expertise needed?
   → YES: Use specialized agent directly
   
3. Is this cross-domain or complex?
   → Simple cross-domain: Sequential workflow (2-3 agents)
   → Complex project: cofounder orchestration
   
4. Is this a persistent/complex problem?
   → YES: Use super-hard-problem-developer
```

1. **Understand Mandatory Agents**: Always use utility agents for file, git, research, and date operations
2. **Learn the XML Syntax**: Use `<agent name="agent-name">task description</agent>` 
3. **Start Simple**: Try single-agent tasks before complex orchestration
4. **Leverage Auto-triggers**: UI changes trigger whimsy-injector, code changes trigger test-writer-fixer
5. **Use cofounder**: For complex projects requiring 4+ agents

### Essential Files

- **[Base Configuration](base-config.yml)**: Global agent settings
- **[Cofounder](bonus/cofounder.md)**: Master orchestrator for complex workflows
- **[File Creator](utilities/file-creator.md)**: Template for utility agents
- **[TypeScript Developer](engineering/typescript-node-developer.md)**: Example of language-specific agent
- **[Master Template](includes/master-software-developer.md)**: Foundation for engineering agents
