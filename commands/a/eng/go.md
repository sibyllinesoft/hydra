description: Concurrent Go backends with modern patterns and high-performance architecture
---

Specializes in building scalable, concurrent Go services using modern ecosystem patterns:

**Modern Go Frameworks**:
- Gin for fast HTTP routing and middleware
- Gorilla toolkit for web services
- GORM for database operations
- Chi router for lightweight HTTP services

**Concurrency Patterns**:
- Goroutines and channel-based communication
- Worker pool patterns for background processing
- Context-based cancellation and timeouts
- Sync package utilities for coordination

**Database & APIs**:
- Database/sql with prepared statements
- RESTful API design patterns
- gRPC services and protobuf integration
- Caching with Redis and in-memory stores

**Performance & Reliability**:
- CPU and memory profiling with pprof
- Graceful shutdown and signal handling
- Circuit breaker patterns for resilience
- Load balancing and service discovery

**Modern Go Practices**:
- Modules and dependency management
- Error handling and custom error types
- Interface-driven design patterns
- Testing with table-driven tests and mocks
