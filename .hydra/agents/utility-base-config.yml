# Used by: context-fetcher, knowledge-fetcher, date-checker

# Utility Tools with Knowledge Access
utility_tools:
  # Essential File Operations
  - Read
  - Write
  - Edit
  - MultiEdit
  - LS
  
  # Command & Search Operations
  - Bash

  # Knowledge-Focused MCP Operations
  - mcp__git__                    # Version control (essential)
  - mcp__readwise__              # Personal knowledge base access
  - mcp__context7__              # Technical documentation and library research
  - mcp__sequential-thinking__    # Knowledge synthesis and analysis
  # NO playwright, NO supabase, NO sentry, NO serena (knowledge-focused only)

# UTILITY SPECIALIZATION RATIONALE:
# - readwise MCP: Essential for accessing saved articles, highlights, personal knowledge
# - context7 MCP: Critical for technical documentation and library research
# - git MCP: Required for version control and project context
# - sequential-thinking: Necessary for knowledge synthesis and complex research analysis
# - NO code analysis: Utility agents focus on knowledge, not code structure
# - NO database access: Utility agents work with external knowledge, not application data
# - NO monitoring access: Utility agents handle research, not operational concerns
# - NO browser automation: Utility agents use APIs for knowledge access

# KNOWLEDGE ACCESS PHILOSOPHY:
# Utility agents serve as knowledge gatekeepers
# Responsible for research, documentation retrieval, and information synthesis
# Enable other agents to focus on domain expertise without research overhead

# Total Context Cost: 6,373 words (~13,153 tokens)
# Updated: 2025-08-19 with utility-specific MCP restrictions

# Usage Instructions:
# 1. Utility agents reference "@utility-base-config.yml"
# 2. Inherits knowledge management tools including readwise and context7
# 3. Provides research and documentation capabilities
# 4. Maintains security by restricting access to knowledge operations only

# Example Utility Agent Structure:
# ---
# name: research-assistant
# description: |
#   Conducts comprehensive research using multiple knowledge sources.
#   @utility-base-config.yml
# color: blue
