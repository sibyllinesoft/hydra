# TODO: Implement the "Living Blueprint" Project Management System

## üéØ High-Level Goal

Transform the project's agent orchestration from using temporary status files to a persistent, unified `genesis.xml` file for each major epic. This "Living Blueprint" will serve as the single source of truth for planning, real-time status, historical audit, and agent knowledge.

Simultaneously, we will refine the `cofounder` agent's role to be a strategic, Socratic analyst that precedes detailed planning, ensuring it's used appropriately for ambiguous, high-level goals.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Technologies

*   **XML Management**: `xmlstarlet` (to be a new core dependency)
*   **Orchestration**: `bash` scripts and Node.js-based `hydra` CLI
*   **State File**: A new, comprehensive `genesis.xml` for each epic.

## üìù Implementation Notes for Claude

*   **Incremental Changes**: Implement phase by phase. After each phase, you can run tests and ensure the system remains stable.
*   **Safety First**: When modifying existing files, always create a backup first or work on a separate branch.
*   **`xmlstarlet` Syntax**: Pay close attention to the `xmlstarlet` commands. Use `sel` (select) for reading and `ed` (edit) for writing. The examples provided are designed to be robust.
*   **Agent Prompts**: The most critical part of this task is updating the system prompts for the agents. They need clear, explicit instructions on how to interact with the `genesis.xml` file.

## üèõÔ∏è Phase 0: Foundation & Environment Setup

This phase prepares the project for the new XML-based system.

*   **Task 0.1: Create the XML Schema Definition (`genesis.xsd`)**
    *   **File:** Create a new file at `rules/genesis.xsd`.
    *   **Action:** Define the formal schema for the `genesis.xml` file. This will be the master reference for validation and agent guidance.
    *   **Content:**
        ```xml
        <!-- rules/genesis.xsd -->
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
        <xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
        
          <xs:element name="projectGenesis">
            <xs:complexType>
              <xs:sequence>
                <xs:element name="metadata" type="metadataType"/>
                <xs:element name="vision" type="visionType"/>

            </xs:complexType>
          </xs:element>
        
          <!-- Define complex types for each section: metadataType, visionType, etc. -->
          <!-- Example for metadataType -->
          <xs:complexType name="metadataType">
            <xs:sequence>
              <xs:element name="projectName" type="xs:string"/>
              <xs:element name="epicName" type="xs:string"/>
              <xs:element name="status" type="xs:string"/>

              <xs:element name="version" type="xs:string"/>
            </xs:sequence>
          </xs:complexType>

          <!-- TODO: Fully define all other complex types (visionType, executionPlanType, etc.) based on our design. -->
        
        </xs:schema>
        ```

*   **Task 0.2: Update Installer & Doctor to check for `xmlstarlet`**
    *   **File:** `installer/install-enhanced.js`
    *   **Action:** Add a new prerequisite check for `xmlstarlet`. If it's not found, provide installation instructions for macOS (brew), Debian/Ubuntu (apt-get), and other systems.
    *   **File:** `bin/hydra.mjs` (in the `HealthChecker` class)
    *   **Action:** Add a new check to `hydra doctor` that verifies `xmlstarlet` is installed and executable.

---

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Phase 1: Redefining the `cofounder` Agent

This phase aligns the `cofounder`'s role with the strategic vision.

*   **Task 1.1: Update `cofounder` Agent Definition**
    *   **File:** `agents/project-management/cofounder.md`
    *   **Action:** Rewrite the agent's definition to reflect its new role.
        *   **Description:** Change to "STRATEGIC HEAD - Use for high-level product analysis and ambiguous goal definition... Outputs a *strategic brief*, not a detailed plan."
        *   **Core Directive:** Emphasize Socratic questioning and transforming ambiguity into a clear *strategic brief*. State explicitly: "You do not create detailed, executable DAGs. Your output is the 'Why' and the 'What' that will be used by a planning agent to create the 'How'."
        *   **Mandatory Workflow:** Update the steps. The final step should be "Handoff strategic brief to a planning agent (e.g., `plan-generator`) or `studio-producer`."

*   **Task 1.2: Update `hydra new` Command Logic**
    *   **File:** `bin/hydra.mjs`
    *   **Action:** Modify the `executeNew` function.
        *   It should now always invoke the `cofounder` agent.
        *   The prompt for `cofounder` should clearly state that its goal is to produce a structured markdown "Strategic Brief".
        *   The output of the `cofounder` session should be saved to a file (e.g., `.claude/epics/<epic-name>/strategic-brief.md`).

*   **Task 1.3: Update All `cofounder` References**
    *   **Action:** Search the entire repository for "cofounder" and update all descriptions and command help texts to reflect its new role as a strategic analyst, not a direct orchestrator.
    *   **Files to check:** `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `commands/a/pm/cofounder.md`, etc.

---

##  Blueprint Core Implementation

This phase builds the new `genesis.xml` file generation and viewing capabilities.

*   **Task 2.1: Create a New `plan-generator` Agent**
    *   **File:** Create `agents/project-management/plan-generator.md`.
    *   **Action:** This agent's sole purpose is to take a "Strategic Brief" (from `cofounder`) and generate the initial `genesis.xml` file, including a detailed `<executionPlan>` DAG.
    *   **Prompt Details:** The system prompt should be very specific, instructing it to:
        1.  Read the `strategic-brief.md`.
        2.  Decompose the strategy into a detailed DAG of tasks.
        3.  Assign appropriate specialist agents to each task.
        4.  Estimate durations.
        5.  Output a valid `genesis.xml` file that conforms to `rules/genesis.xsd`.

*   **Task 2.2: Create a New `hydra plan` Command**
    *   **File:** `bin/hydra.mjs`
    *   **Action:** Add a new command `hydra plan <epic-name>`.
    *   **Logic:** This command will invoke the `plan-generator` agent, feeding it the `strategic-brief.md` for the specified epic. The agent's output (`genesis.xml`) will be saved to `.claude/epics/<epic-name>/genesis.xml`.

*   **Task 2.3: Create the `hydra pm view` Command**
    *   **File:** `bin/hydra.mjs`
    *   **Action:** Add a new command `hydra pm view <epic-name>`.
    *   **Logic:**
        1.  Check for `.claude/epics/<epic-name>/genesis.xml`.
        2.  Use `bash` and `xmlstarlet` to parse the XML.
        3.  Generate a human-readable markdown summary and print it to the console.
        4.  **Summary should include:** Project Status, Vision Summary, Architecture Stack, a visual representation of the DAG, and the current status of all tasks.

*   **Task 2.4: Deprecate Old Schema**
    *   **File:** `rules/workflow-status-schema.md`
    *   **Action:** Replace its content with a note pointing to the new `rules/genesis.xsd` file.

---

## üîó Phase 3: Agent Integration with the "Living Blueprint"

This phase refactors key agents to use the `genesis.xml` system.

*   **Task 3.1: Create a Shared Instruction File for Specialists**
    *   **File:** Create a new file at `instructions/SPECIALIST-AGENT-PROTOCOL.md`.
    *   **Action:** This file will be `@mentioned` by all specialist agents. It will contain the mandatory instructions for interacting with `genesis.xml`.
    *   **Content:**
        *   "On startup, you MUST read context from the `genesis.xml` file provided in your prompt."
        *   "Use the following `xmlstarlet` command to read the project vision: `xmlstarlet sel -t -v '/projectGenesis/vision/problemStatement' genesis.xml`."
        *   "Upon task completion, you MUST update the `genesis.xml` file. Use this command to update your task's result: `xmlstarlet ed -L -u '/projectGenesis/executionPlan/tasks/task[@id=\"your-task-id\"]/result/summary' -v \"Your summary\" genesis.xml`."
        *   "You MUST then move your task reference to the completed section: `xmlstarlet ed -L -m '/projectGenesis/executionPlan/status_tracker/in_progress/task_ref[@id=\"your-task-id\"]' '/projectGenesis/executionPlan/status_tracker/completed'`."
        *   Include examples for reading, updating status, adding to the knowledge base, and logging actions.

*   **Task 3.2: Refactor the `parallel-worker` Agent**
    *   **File:** `agents/project-management/parallel-worker.md`
    *   **Action:** Completely overhaul its `mandatory_workflow`.
        1.  **Input:** Now takes a single argument: the path to `genesis.xml`.
        2.  **Plan Step:** Removed. It now reads the DAG directly from the XML.
        3.  **Dispatch Step:** Reads the `<execution_dag>` to determine which level to execute. Spawns `claude -p` processes for each task in the current parallel set.
        4.  **Prompt Construction:** The prompt for subagents MUST now reference `instructions/SPECIALIST-AGENT-PROTOCOL.md` and provide the path to `genesis.xml`.
        5.  **Monitoring:** The loop now only needs to read `genesis.xml` to check the status of tasks and determine when a level is complete.
        6.  **Cleanup:** The git cleanup step remains but should be enhanced to create a final consolidated PR summary based on the `<result>` summaries from the XML.

*   **Task 3.3: Refactor the `project-shipper` Agent**
    *   **File:** `agents/project-management/project-shipper.md`
    *   **Action:** Update its logic for `hydra recap`. It should now primarily read the completed `genesis.xml` file to source its information, including the audit log and knowledge base insights.

*   **Task 3.4: Update All Specialist Agents**
    *   **Action:** For every agent in `agents/engineering`, `agents/design`, etc., add a line to their system prompt: `@instructions/SPECIALIST-AGENT-PROTOCOL.md`. This ensures all agents know how to interact with the new system.

---

## üìÑ Phase 4: Documentation & Finalization

This phase ensures the entire system is cohesive and well-documented.

*   **Task 4.1: Update `AGENTS.md`**
    *   **Action:** Add the "Living Blueprint" section we designed in our previous conversation.
    *   **Action:** Update the descriptions for `cofounder`, `parallel-worker`, and `project-shipper` to reflect their new roles in the `genesis.xml` workflow.
    *   **Action:** Add an entry for the new `plan-generator` agent.

*   **Task 4.2: Update `README.md`**
    *   **Action:** Revise the "How It Works" and "Workflow Experience" sections to describe the new `hydra new` -> `cofounder` -> `hydra plan` -> `hydra run` flow.

*   **Task 4.3: Create `LIVING-BLUEPRINT-GUIDE.md`**
    *   **File:** Create a new root-level `LIVING-BLUEPRINT-GUIDE.md`.
    *   **Action:** This will be the definitive guide to the philosophy and technical implementation of the `genesis.xml` system. It should include the schema explanation, agent interaction protocols, and the vision behind executable documentation.

*   **Task 4.4: Final Review**
    *   **Action:** Review all modified files for consistency.
    *   **Action:** Run through the entire workflow manually: `hydra new` -> `hydra plan` -> `hydra run` -> `hydra pm view` -> `hydra recap`.
    *   **Action:** Ensure all documentation is cross-linked and up-to-date.

    #### 1. Tune the `cofounder` Agent's Directives
The orchestrator needs to be guided to use the `cofounder` correctly.

*   **File to Edit:** `agents/project-management/cofounder.md`
*   **Change:** Make its handoff responsibility explicit in the `<core_directive>` and `<mandatory_workflow>`.

You've hit the nail on the head. This is a classic and subtle AI orchestration bug. The system isn't just randomly picking agents; it's following a flawed logical pattern.

Your diagnosis is exactly right: **it doesn't know *when* to use `cofounder`**.

### The Diagnosis: Misinterpreting "Complex" vs. "Ambiguous"

The orchestrator's current logic appears to be:

1.  Read the `TODO.md`.
2.  Recognize the task is **complex**.
3.  Conclude: "Complex tasks require strategic analysis."
4.  Dispatch to `cofounder`, the top strategic agent.

This is a logical error. The `cofounder`'s purpose isn't to analyze *complex* tasks; it's to analyze **ambiguous, high-level, and undefined** tasks to *create* a complex plan.

**The Analogy:** You've handed the orchestrator a detailed engineering blueprint (`TODO.md`). The orchestrator then takes that blueprint to the company CEO (`cofounder`) and asks, "Could you please do a strategic analysis on this blueprint?" The CEO's job was already done when they *commissioned* the blueprint. The orchestrator should have taken the blueprint directly to the engineering lead (`parallel-worker`).

The orchestrator correctly identified that the *project* is complex, but failed to recognize that the *next step* was simple and well-defined: execute the existing plan.

### Tuning Recommendations

We need to make the `cofounder`'s role so explicit that the orchestrator understands when **NOT** to use it. We'll do this by sharpening its directives and, crucially, by making the `parallel-worker` the obvious choice for executing pre-defined plans.

#### 1. Sharpen the `cofounder` Agent's Anti-Triggers (Most Important)

We need to add explicit negative constraints to the `cofounder`'s definition.

*   **File to Edit:** `agents/project-management/cofounder.md`
*   **Action:** Add a "When NOT to Use" section to the description and an `input_contract` to its capabilities to make its expected input explicit.

 ## üèÜ Specialized Agent Directory
 *Agents are organized by departments (engineering, design, marketing, product, operations, testing). Each embodies best practices, deep expertise, and auto-coordination with others for consistency and quality.*

```

By making these changes, you are providing much stronger signals to the orchestrator. You are explicitly telling it:
1.  **`cofounder`:** "Do not call me if you already have a plan."
2.  **`parallel-worker`:** "If you have a plan, call me."
3.  **`AGENTS.md`:** "Here is the exact rule: vague goal -> `cofounder`; detailed plan -> `parallel-worker`."

### The Plan: Create a Dispatch Debugger

1.  **Create a Wrapper Script (`debug-dispatch.sh`):** This script will be our logger. It will take a command as an argument, write that command to a log file, and then execute it.
2.  **Modify the `parallel-worker` Agent:** We will temporarily update its instructions to use our new wrapper script instead of calling `claude -p` directly.
3.  **Run the Workflow:** Execute the same "Living Blueprint" task.
4.  **Analyze the Log:** Check the log file to see exactly what commands the `parallel-worker` dispatched.

---

### Step 1: Create the Debug Wrapper Script

First, we need to create the script that will act as our hook.

**Action:** Use the `file-creator` agent to create the following file.

```xml
<agent name="file-creator">
Create a new file at `scripts/debug-dispatch.sh` with the following content. After creating the file, make it executable using `chmod +x scripts/debug-dispatch.sh`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Hydra Dispatch Debugger Wrapper v1.0
# This script logs commands passed to it before executing them.

set -euo pipefail

# Define the log file path
LOG_DIR=".claude/logs"
LOG_FILE="$LOG_DIR/dispatch.log"

# Ensure log directory exists
mkdir -p "$LOG_DIR"

# Get current timestamp
TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")

# Log the received command arguments to the file and to stderr
# The 'tee' command allows us to see this in real-time in the Claude Code UI
echo "[$TIMESTAMP] DISPATCHED: $@" | tee -a "$LOG_FILE"

# Execute the original command that was passed to this script
# 'exec' replaces this script's process with the new one, which is cleaner.
exec "$@"
```
</agent>
```

### Step 2: Modify the `parallel-worker` Agent to Use the Wrapper

Now, we'll instruct the `parallel-worker` to use our new script. This is the "hooking" part.

*   **Action:** You can apply this change manually or ask an agent to do it. We need to change the `MANDATORY BASH SPAWNING` instruction.

Here is the `diff` of the required change:

```diff
--- a/agents/project-management/parallel-worker.md
+++ b/agents/project-management/parallel-worker.md

   <step number="4" name="Dispatch Parallel Agents">

+    <action>**MANDATORY BASH SPAWNING (DEBUG MODE)**: Use the `Bash` tool to execute `bash scripts/debug-dispatch.sh claude -p "Your detailed prompt here" &` for each subagent for non-blocking parallel execution. This provides a debug log of all dispatched commands.</action>
     <action>Update the XML file by moving the `<task_ref>` for each dispatched task from `<pending>` to `<in_progress>`.</action>
   </step>
   <step number="5" name="Construct Subagent Prompt">
```

This change tells the agent to prepend `bash scripts/debug-dispatch.sh` to its `claude -p` command.

### Step 3: Run the Workflow and Check the Output

Now, run the same process as before.

```xml
<agent name="parallel-worker">
Implement the "Living Blueprint" Project Management System as defined in TODO.md.
</agent>
```

**What to Watch For:**

1.  **In the Claude Code UI:** As the `parallel-worker` dispatches tasks, you will now see the output from our script directly in the tool output, thanks to the `tee -a` command. It will look something like this:

    ```
    ‚óè Bash(bash scripts/debug-dispatch.sh claude -p "You are the file-creator. Task: create-xsd-schema (ID: 001)..." &)
      ‚éø [2025-08-23T01:19:00Z] DISPATCHED: claude -p "You are the file-creator. Task: create-xsd-schema (ID: 001)..."
    ```

2.  **In the Log File:** After the run (or during it), you can inspect the persistent log file we created.

    **Command:** `cat .claude/logs/dispatch.log`

### Expected Log Output (`dispatch.log`)

You should see a file with entries that look like this, providing a clear and permanent record of every sub-agent dispatch:

```log
[2025-08-23T01:19:00Z] DISPATCHED: claude -p "You are the file-creator agent. Task ID: create-genesis-xsd. Create a new file at rules/genesis.xsd... Your work is part of the 'Living Blueprint' epic. Read the full project context from .claude/epics/living-blueprint/genesis.xml. Upon completion, you MUST update the XML..." &
[2025-08-23T01:19:01Z] DISPATCHED: claude -p "You are the refactoring-specialist. Task ID: update-installer-check. Update installer/install-enhanced.js to add a prerequisite check for xmlstarlet... Your work is part of the 'Living Blueprint' epic. Read the full project context from .claude/epics/living-blueprint/genesis.xml. Upon completion, you MUST update the XML..." &
[2025-08-23T01:19:02Z] DISPATCHED: claude -p "You are the typescript-node-developer. Task ID: update-hydra-doctor. Add a new check to the HealthChecker class in bin/hydra.mjs to verify xmlstarlet is installed... Your work is part of the 'Living Blueprint' epic. Read the full project context from .claude/epics/living-blueprint/genesis.xml. Upon completion, you MUST update the XML..." &```

### Analysis of the Debug Output

This log file gives you the ground truth. You can now verify:
*   **Is it dispatching?** Yes, entries in the log prove it.
*   **Is it dispatching in parallel?** The close timestamps show it's firing off commands without waiting.
*   **Is it dispatching the *right* commands?** You can read the full prompt being sent to each sub-agent and debug the quality of the instructions. Are they clear? Do they include the correct file paths and task IDs?

This is a powerful debugging tool that moves you from guessing what the orchestrator is doing to *knowing* what it's doing.

### How to Revert

Once you are satisfied with the debugging, you can revert the changes:
1.  **Edit `agents/project-management/parallel-worker.md`** and remove the `bash scripts/debug-dispatch.sh` part from the `MANDATORY BASH SPAWNING` instruction.
2.  (Optional) Delete the script `scripts/debug-dispatch.sh` and the log file `.claude/logs/dispatch.log`.
