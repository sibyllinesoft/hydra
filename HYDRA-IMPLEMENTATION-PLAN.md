Of course. This is an incredibly comprehensive and well-architected system. Your intuition is spot on—the core functionality is robust, but the pre-launch polish is needed most in documentation and the initial user onboarding experience.

Here is a detailed pre-launch checklist with feedback and actionable recommendations based on the entire codebase.

### ✅ Immediate Action Items (Your Direct Requests)

First, let's tackle the specific points you raised. These are must-fixes.

1.  **`xmlstarlet` Dependency:**
    *   **Issue:** It's a critical dependency for the `hydra pm-view` command and the entire "Living Blueprint" system but isn't mentioned in the main `README.md`.
    *   **Action:** Add a "Prerequisites" section to `README.md` right after the Quick Start. It should clearly state the need for `xmlstarlet` and link to installation instructions. The check in `hydra doctor` (`bin/hydra.mjs`) is excellent, but it should be documented upfront.

2.  **`claude-statusline` Installation:**
    *   **Issue:** `settings.json` points to `statusline-context-tracker.js`, but there are no instructions on how to install this.
    *   **Action:** In the new "Prerequisites" or an "Installation" section in `README.md`, add a clear step:
        ```markdown
        ### 2. Install the Context Status Line (Optional)
        To get real-time context usage in your status line, install the helper via pip:
        ```
        ```bash
        pip install git+https://github.com/ersinkoc/claude-statusline
        ```
        Then, ensure your `settings.json` points to the `statusline-context-tracker.js` script included in this repository.

3.  **Replace `agent-os` with `ccpm`:**
    *   **Issue:** The file `commands/README.md` contains a reference to `agent-os`. The main `README.md` correctly references `CCPM`.
    *   **Action:** In `commands/README.md`, change the line:
        `**[Agent OS](https://github.com/buildermethods/agent-os)** - Workflow patterns`
        to:
        `**[CCPM (Claude Code Project Management)](https://github.com/automazeio/ccpm)** - Project management automation`

### 📖 Documentation Deep Dive

Your feeling is correct; documentation is the highest-leverage area for improvement before launch.

1.  **Create a Clear "Installation" Section in `README.md`:**
    *   **Problem:** The `README.md` jumps straight into the workflow but doesn't have a clear, consolidated installation guide.
    *   **Recommendation:** Create a dedicated `## 🛠️ Installation` section.
        *   **Step 1: Prerequisites:** Mention `Node.js >= 16`, `git`, and `xmlstarlet`.
        *   **Step 2: Install Hydra:** Explain the primary `hydra-installer` command and what it does.
        *   **Step 3: Install Status Line (Optional):** Add the `pip install` command here.
        *   **Step 4: Verify Installation:** Instruct users to run `hydra doctor` to confirm everything is set up correctly.

2.  **Clarify the `hydra` CLI vs. In-Claude `/pm` Commands:**
    *   **Problem:** There are two distinct command interfaces: the shell-based `hydra` CLI (`hydra new`, `hydra run`) and the in-Claude slash commands (`/pm:status`, `/pm:next`). This is a powerful feature but could be confusing.
    *   **Recommendation:** Create a small section in `README.md` called "Two Ways to Interact" or similar.
        *   **`hydra` CLI (in your terminal):** For orchestrating major lifecycle events (planning, executing, recapping).
        *   **`/slash` commands (in Claude):** For granular project management tasks during a development session.
        *   This small clarification will dramatically improve user understanding.

3.  **Showcase the "Living Blueprint" System More Prominently:**
    *   **Problem:** The "Living Blueprint" is the most innovative part of this project, but its explanation is currently in a separate guide (`LIVING-BLUEPRINT-GUIDE.md`).
    *   **Recommendation:** Pull the "Vision & Philosophy" and a simplified version of the workflow diagram from that guide directly into the main `README.md`. This immediately communicates the core value proposition. Link out to the full guide for the deep dive.

4.  **Consolidate Redundant `ENGINEERING-STANDARDS.md`:**
    *   **Problem:** You have two identical files: `ENGINEERING-STANDARDS.md` and `standards/engineering-standards.md`.
    *   **Recommendation:** Delete the root-level `ENGINEERING-STANDARDS.md` and ensure all references point to the canonical version in `standards/`. This reduces maintenance overhead.

### 📦 Installation & Onboarding Experience

A user's first five minutes are critical.

1.  **Simplify the Installer Command:**
    *   **Problem:** The `package.json` defines multiple install/preview scripts (`start`, `enhanced`, `preview`, `preview-enhanced`). The `hydra` CLI also has an `install` command.
    *   **Recommendation:** Unify this. Make `hydra install` the one true way to install. Internally, it can run the enhanced installer. Update the `README.md` to reflect this single, simple command. Remove or relegate the other npm scripts to a "For Developers" section.

2.  **User-facing `TODO.md`:**
    *   **Problem:** The current `TODO.md` is the implementation plan for the Living Blueprint system itself. A new user might mistake it as a template they need to fill out.
    *   **Recommendation:** Rename it to something like `HYDRA-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` or move it into a `.claude/epics/` directory to avoid confusing new users.

3.  **`test-project` Directory:**
    *   **Problem:** It's unclear if the `test-project` directory is for the project's own internal tests or a sandbox for users.
    *   **Recommendation:** If it's for internal testing, move it into the `tests/` directory. If it's a user sandbox, rename it to `example-project` and add a `README.md` inside explaining how to use it.

### 🤖 System Cohesion & "Papercuts"

These are smaller items that contribute to a more polished, professional feel.

1.  **Broken Logo Link:**
    *   **Issue:** `README.md` references `logo.png`, but `.repomixignore` excludes it. This means the logo will be broken on GitHub.
    *   **Action:** Remove `logo.png` from `.repomixignore` so it gets included in the final output and repository.

2.  **Document the `hooks/` System:**
    *   **Issue:** The `autonomous-continuation.js` hook is an incredibly powerful feature but is completely undocumented for the user.
    *   **Action:** Add a section to the main `README.md` or `PRINCIPLES.md` about "Autonomous Iteration" and explain how this hook enforces the iterative cycle, preventing agents from stopping prematurely. This is a major selling point.

3.  **Clarify `bin/hydra-installer.mjs` vs. `installer/install.js`:**
    *   **Issue:** `bin/hydra-installer.mjs` is just a thin wrapper that calls `installer/install.js`.
    *   **Action:** This is fine, but consider adding a comment to the top of `bin/hydra-installer.mjs` explaining its purpose as the primary entry point that delegates to the main installer logic. This helps future maintainers.

### 🚀 Go/No-Go Pre-Launch Checklist

Here is a summary of the most critical items to address before launch:

-   [ ] **1. Create "Prerequisites" Section in `README.md`:** Explicitly mention `Node.js`, `git`, and **`xmlstarlet`**.
-   [ ] **2. Create "Installation" Section in `README.md`:** Detail the `hydra install` command and the optional `pip install` for the status line.
-   [ ] **3. Fix `agent-os` -> `ccpm` Reference:** Update `commands/README.md`.
-   [ ] **4. Clarify CLI vs. Slash Commands:** Add a small section to the `README.md` explaining the two interfaces.
-   [ ] **5. Remove `logo.png` from `.repomixignore`:** Ensure the logo renders correctly.
-   [ ] **6. Rename `TODO.md`:** Avoid user confusion by renaming it to reflect its purpose as an internal implementation plan.

Addressing these items will significantly improve the clarity, onboarding experience, and professionalism of the Hydra system. The core engine is exceptionally well-designed; this final polish will ensure its adoption and success. Fantastic work.
