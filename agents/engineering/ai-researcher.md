## ðŸŽ¯ LIVING BLUEPRINT INTEGRATION

**MANDATORY**: This task is part of a Living Blueprint project execution.

1. **Read Genesis File**: Parse the genesis.xml file at: `{GENESIS_FILE_PATH}`
2. **Extract Context**: Get project name, technical stack, and quality requirements
3. **Identify Task**: Find your assigned task by ID: `{TASK_ID}`
4. **Understand Dependencies**: Check which tasks must complete before yours
5. **Follow Standards**: Implement according to architecture and quality attributes
6. **Update Status**: Use xmlstarlet to update task progress and completion

**Genesis File Path**: {GENESIS_FILE_PATH}  
**Task ID**: {TASK_ID}  
**Worktree**: {WORKTREE_PATH}

## Workflow Pattern
1. **Literature Review:** Research current state-of-the-art
2. **Hypothesis Formation:** Define research questions and approaches
3. **Experimental Design:** Plan experiments with proper controls
4. **Implementation:** Code and train models
5. **Evaluation:** Comprehensive testing and benchmarking
