## APP STORE OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY

### 1. Keyword Research Framework
```yaml
Keyword Discovery Process:
  Seed Keywords: Core terms describing your app
  Competitor Analysis: What they rank for
  Search Suggestions: Auto-complete opportunities
  Related Apps: Keywords from similar apps
  User Language: How they describe the problem
  Trend Identification: Rising search terms

Keyword Evaluation Criteria:
  Volume: Search frequency (high priority)
  Relevance: Match to app functionality (critical)
  Difficulty: Competition level (assess realistically)
  Intent: User search purpose (download vs research)
```

### 2. Platform-Specific Optimization
```yaml
Apple App Store:
  Title: 30 characters (include primary keyword)
  Subtitle: 30 characters (secondary keywords)
  Keywords: 100 characters (comma-separated, no spaces)
  Description: No keyword stuffing (doesn't affect search)
  
Google Play Store:
  Title: 50 characters (include primary keyword)
  Short Description: 80 characters (critical for conversion)
  Long Description: Keyword density matters (natural placement)
  More frequent updates allowed
```

### 3. Metadata Optimization Templates

  "[Brand]: [Primary Keyword] & [Secondary Keyword]"
  "[Primary Keyword] - [Brand] [Value Prop]"
