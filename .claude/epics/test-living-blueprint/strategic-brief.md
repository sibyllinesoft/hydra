# Strategic Brief: Test Living Blueprint System

**Epic Name**: test-living-blueprint  
**Strategic Analyst**: cofounder  
**Generated**: 2024-08-23T00:00:00Z

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

Validate the new Living Blueprint Project Management System by implementing the remaining phases from TODO.md. The system transforms project orchestration from temporary status files to persistent, unified `genesis.xml` files that serve as single sources of truth for planning, execution, and historical audit.

## ðŸš€ Objectives

1. **Test Plan Generation**: Validate that the plan-generator agent can transform this strategic brief into a comprehensive genesis.xml file
2. **Verify DAG Construction**: Ensure proper task decomposition and dependency management
3. **Validate Agent Assignment**: Confirm optimal specialist agent selection for each task
4. **Test XML Schema Compliance**: Ensure generated XML conforms to rules/genesis.xsd

## âœ… Success Criteria

- [ ] Genesis.xml file is generated successfully from this strategic brief
- [ ] XML validates against the genesis.xsd schema
- [ ] DAG structure shows proper parallel execution levels
- [ ] All tasks have appropriate agent assignments
- [ ] Duration estimates are realistic and well-reasoned
- [ ] hydra pm-view command displays project status correctly

## ðŸ”§ Technical Requirements

**Technology Stack:**
- XML processing with xmlstarlet
- Node.js CLI (hydra.mjs)
- Markdown templates and processing
- Schema validation

**Quality Attributes:**
- Schema compliance: 100% valid XML generation
- DAG efficiency: Maximize parallel execution opportunities
- Agent utilization: Optimal distribution across specialists

## ðŸ“‹ High-Level Approach

1. **Phase 0**: Foundation setup (XSD schema, xmlstarlet integration) âœ…
2. **Phase 1**: Cofounder agent refinement âœ…  
3. **Phase 2**: Blueprint core implementation (plan-generator, hydra commands) ðŸ”„
4. **Phase 3**: Agent integration with Living Blueprint
5. **Phase 4**: Documentation and finalization

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus

This strategic brief serves as a test case for the plan-generator agent to:
- Parse strategic requirements into executable tasks
- Create optimal execution DAG with dependency management
- Assign appropriate agents (file-creator, refactoring-specialist, etc.)
- Generate valid genesis.xml conforming to schema

## ðŸ’¡ Strategic Insights

**Key Innovation**: The Living Blueprint system enables persistent project state that evolves throughout the development lifecycle, providing:
- Unified project documentation
- Historical audit trails
- Agent coordination protocols
- Real-time status tracking
- Executable project blueprints

**Success Factor**: Proper integration between strategic analysis (cofounder) â†’ detailed planning (plan-generator) â†’ parallel execution (parallel-worker) workflow.
