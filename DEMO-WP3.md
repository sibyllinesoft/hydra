## Technical Architecture

### CLI Framework
- **Commander.js**: Professional CLI with argument parsing and help generation
- **Modular Design**: Separated concerns for path resolution, template processing, and Claude integration
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching with user-friendly messages

### Template Processing Engine
- **Dynamic Loading**: Reads templates from configurable prompts directory
- **Variable Substitution**: Supports {{variable}} syntax with validation
- **Template Validation**: Warns about unresolved variables
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of missing template files

### Claude Integration
- **Availability Detection**: Checks for Claude command before execution
- **Process Spawning**: Proper process management with stdio inheritance
- **Argument Handling**: Safe handling of large, complex prompt arguments
- **Session Management**: Clean handoff and exit code reporting

### Path Resolution System
- **Multi-Mode Support**: Works with global and project installations
- **Automatic Detection**: Finds installation based on directory structure
- **Fallback Strategy**: Multiple search paths for robustness
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on different operating systems

### Health Check Diagnostics
- **GitHub Integration**: Uses `gh` CLI for authentication status
- **File Integrity**: Compares against source repository
- **Local Validation**: Checks project structure and dependencies
- **Actionable Reporting**: Clear status indicators and recommendations

## Validation Results

‚úÖ **100% Test Pass Rate** - All 10 validation tests passed:
1. Primary CLI file exists and is executable
2. package.json includes hydra binary
3. Commander.js dependency is installed
4. All four core commands are available
5. All required template files exist
6. Individual command help works
7. CLI handles missing templates gracefully
8. Doctor command runs health checks
9. Path resolution works for both installation modes
10. Template variable substitution works

## Next Steps

The primary CLI is now ready for integration with:
1. **Installer Updates**: Update installation scripts to include the new CLI
2. **Documentation**: Create user guides and workflow documentation
3. **Testing**: Real-world testing with Claude Code integration
4. **Refinement**: Based on user feedback and usage patterns

Work Package 3 successfully delivers a professional, robust CLI that serves as the primary interface for the Hydra development lifecycle orchestration system.
